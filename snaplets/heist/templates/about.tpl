        <h2>What is the Snap Framework?</h2>

        <p><img class="small-logo" src="/media/img/logo-small.png" /><strong>Snap</strong> is a simple web development framework for unix
          systems, written in the <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>
          programming language.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Snap</strong> aims to be the <i>de facto</i> web toolkit
          for Haskell, on the basis of:
        </p>

        <ul class="compact">
          <li>High performance</li>
          <li>High design standards</li>
          <li>Simplicity and ease of use, even for Haskell beginners</li>
          <li>Excellent documentation</li>
          <li>Robustness and high test coverage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the project's status?</h2>
        <p>
          Snap launched to the public in May, 2010.  The core framework
          contains:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A fast HTTP server library.</li>
          <li>A sensible and clean monad for web programming.</li>
          <li>An HTML-based templating system for generating pages that allows
              you to bind Haskell functionality to tags without getting
              PHP-style tag soup all over your pants</li>
          <li>A high-level system called Snaplets for building modular web
              applications.</li>
          <li>Built-in snaplets for templating, session management, and
              authentication.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Snap runs on *nix platforms; it has been tested on Linux and Mac OSX
          Snow Leopard.  Windows support was added more recently, but it not
          as well-tested.
